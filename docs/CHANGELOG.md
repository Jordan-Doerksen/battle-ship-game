Repo bootstrap from the owner-approved design brief (`docs/DESIGN-BRIEF.md`):

- Governance docs seeded: `DECISIONS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, this changelog.
- Greenfield Godot 4.7 project (`project.godot`), re-deriving fulfillment's structural patterns rather
  than copying them (DECISIONS D1.3): seeded `Rng`, generic `Pool`, minimal `GameWorld` truth object,
  fixed-timestep `Sim` step root (no systems yet), `Main.gd`/`Main.tscn` accumulator loop, and a
  `FieldRenderer` that draws a placeholder hull + starfield to prove the sim→render loop is alive and
  one-way.
- Config split per-system from the start (`SimConfig`/`sim.tres`, `FieldConfig`/`field.tres`) instead
  of one monolithic balance file — a deliberate departure from fulfillment's ~300-line
  `BalanceConfig.gd`, so tuning any one future system (movement, hardpoints, sonar, …) only ever
  requires reading its own small config file.
- `verify.sh` gate (gdparse sweep / import / boot probe) + `tests/probe_sim.gd`.
- No gameplay systems yet — naval movement, hardpoints, domain-tagged weapons, sonar, and depth charges
  are each a future `/spec-feature` chunk.
